So you want to become a web developer? There is a ton of work ahead of you, but fear not! In this post I'll do my best to put you on the right path to learn all of the crucial parts of the modern front-end world from absolute scratch.

## 1. Foundations first

As a first step you should learn the basics of the **HTML5** and **CSS3**, as these are the primary building blocks of the web. HTML is responsible for the content and structure of the page, such as all the text, lists, forms, anchors and so on. CSS on the other hand is responsible for the styling of these elements, such as color, font-size, margins and positioning.

### Where should I learn all of that?

I think the best place to start would be a **freecodecamp.** It includes a local text-editor where you'll be writing the code for each lesson. All of the lessons are placed in a logical order where one lesson lead to the next one and it's absolutely free! I'd suggest sticking to the HTML/CSS part for now and omit the Javascript, as there is a lot to learn just from that. Visit the freecodecamp page [here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
