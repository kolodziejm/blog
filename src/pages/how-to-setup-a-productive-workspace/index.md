Want to improve your workspace? Here I'm going to give you some suggestions on how you can do that and become more productive as a result!

## Where should I begin?

It all starts with us. Everyone is different, what works for one person may not necessarily work for the other, so it's important to experiment and see what exactly works for us.

I think however that there are a couple of universal ideas that'll work for most people. I'd personally split them into 3 groups - **tools**, **software** and **hardware.** Let's start with the latter as I think it'll benefit your workspace the most.

## Hardware

This is an incredibly important topic as every productive workflow starts with this. From my experience the 2 biggest game changers are:

- **SSD drive**
- **Multiple screen setup**

It's 2019. The SSDs are really affordable nowadays and there are basically no excuses not to use them. If you don't have one already, make getting it your priority!

Once you have one - you'll need to install your OS and working software on it such as text editor and a browser, basically everything that you need fast access to. You can keep your static files like images and downloads that you don't use very often on the HDD, in order to save more space for the important stuff on SSD.

Now your computer should speed up dramatically. Booting, installing NPM packages, working in the text editor and switching between tabs and programs should be a breeze.

When it comes to screens I think (at least for the web developer) that **3 screens** is a good setup. First one for the text editor, second for the browser and the last one for the utilities like a terminal, Discord etc.

Once you start using multiple screens you won't believe how you could've worked on only one screen alt-tabbing all the time!

> Here's a tip. If you have a PC and a laptop you can use the latter as an additional screen! I use **spacedesk** for this purpose, it allows you to spin up a server on your desktop to which you can connect with your laptop thus using it as another monitor.

## Software

There is a lot to choose from, and everyone have different needs so you have to find out what works best for you. However I feel that most productive setups I've seen have 4 things in common:

- **pomodoro timer**

I recommend using a dedicated app for this, ideally integrated with a task time tracker. The app I'm using is called **Super Productivity**, you can check it out [here.](https://super-productivity.com/)

It allows you to set a time for pomodoro session, set the tasks and then track the time for each individual task while pomodoro timer takes care of when you should take a break.

- **time tracker**

Time tracker is useful, when you want to know how you've spent every minute at the computer. It's really handy when you want to identify your biggest time wasters.

The one that I'm using is called [**Rescue Time.**](https://www.rescuetime.com/) Sometimes the reports can truly open your eyes, especially when you'll just start using it.

- **todo list**

I'd say that the most popular solution is [**Todoist.**](https://todoist.com) It allows you to easily schedule your tasks in advance or set them repeatedly.

If you want to motivate yourself with a bit of gamification, then [**Habitica**](https://habitica.com/static/home) would be a good app to use.

I'm personally using a custom solution that I've made, it's called [**Habit Creator.**](https://kolodziejm.github.io/habit-creator/#/habit-creator/) It allows you to setup tasks that you want to do daily, after each day the tasks will refresh. You can set a difficulty for each one, collect coins for completing them and then buy rewards you setup in the shop. You'll also get the achievements along the way.

- **project tracker**

This software is used for tracking things where a simple todo list wouldn't suffice. It also allows for collaboration with other team members. The one that I'm using is [**Trello.**](https://trello.com/)

## Tools

These are the utilities you can use as a substitute or addition to the software above.

- **sticky notes**

Good old sticky notes, can serve as an alternative to the todo list software I listed. Just stick them to the front of your monitor, and take them off once you'll finish the tasks. Good part is that they're always visible, you don't have to explicitly go and check out your tasks in a software.

- **whiteboard or wall chalkboard**

These can be used as a project tracker to some extent. You can easily write down the steps required in particular project and mark relations between them.

## Summary

The lists above should give you an overview for how you can create your very own productive workspace. The hardware part is the most important one really, because you can see immediate benefits from switching from HDD to SDD or one monitor to multiple screens.

The software is usually just a preference, check out all the options and pick the best one what works for you.
