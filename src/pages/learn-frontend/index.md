So you want to become a web developer? There is a ton of work ahead of you, but fear not! In this post I'll do my best to put you on the right path to learn all of the crucial parts of the modern front-end world from absolute scratch.

## 1. Foundations first

As a first step you should learn the basics of the **HTML5** and **CSS3**, as these are the primary building blocks of the web. HTML is responsible for the content and structure of the page, such as all the text, lists, forms, anchors and so on. CSS on the other hand is responsible for the styling of these elements, such as color, font-size, margins and positioning.

### Where should I learn these?

I think the best place to start would be a **freecodecamp.** It includes a built-in text-editor where you'll be writing the code for each lesson. All of the lessons are placed in a logical order where one lesson lead to the next one and it's absolutely free! I'd suggest sticking to the HTML/CSS part for now and omit the JavaScript, as there is a lot to learn just from that. Visit the freecodecamp page [here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Back when I was starting out the freecodecamp course wasn't so well organsized, so I had to supplement my knowledge from different sources. One of the best I've found was a [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU) channel on Youtube. If you prefer to watch a tutorial instead of reading it - this could be a good alternative. One important thing to note though - **you should still code along with the instructor!** By doing that you'll greatly speed up your learning process as you'll be proned to making errors and fixing them!

If you want to follow along the video you'll need a good text editor - I recommend using **Visual Studio Code.** It's fast, has an intuitive interface, lots of plugins to choose from and best of all - it's completely free! :)

> It's a good idea to develop some kind of note system when you start learning. You can either use a simple paper notebook or some kind of software solution like **Evernote.** Write down most important information from each lesson - that way you can easily go back and refresh the material, and by writing a summary you should understand the lesson even better.

### What should you know right now?
* HTML page structure and tags
* HTML5 semantics
* CSS selectors, basic properties, box model


## 2. Practicing the basics

Okay, so now you know the basics - great job! You should start doing some simple projects - a landing page for example. If you haven't done it already - there are some practical challenges you can do on **freecodecamp** - you should definitely check them out. It's really important to put in that effort and create something practical on your own and not just stick to the tutorials. They should only give you the foundation to build your own projects! 


## 3. Let's make it responsive

By now you should have a solid understanding of the core concepts. It's time to go to the next level. What you should focus on right now is making your websites responsive. What that means is that your website can **scale very well to different kinds of devices - from mobile to desktop.** It's especially important in 2018, as more and more users consume Internet content on mobile devices.

What I'd recommend is going to Udemy and buying the Jonas Schmedtmann's course - [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/?couponCode=GITHUB4). I'm not paid to advertise this course and this isn't a ref-link, I just went through it myself and I think it's a money well spent :) It'll learn you the best practices when it comes to responsive web design and you'll create 3 awesome projects too! If you can afford it I would definitely suggest checking that out.

If you don't want to spend any money on the course it's fine too, there is a ton of free content on the Internet. You'll just have to find it on your own and it may not be as clearly structured. **Freecodecamp** and **Youtube** are your best bets :)

>One tip from me - you should **avoid using the CSS frameworks for now** such as Bootstrap or Bulma. I myself touched Bootstrap too early and it made me lazy to do my own custom responsive CSS. As a front-end developer you should have an ability to write your own CSS and not depend on these external tools, they're great later on if you want a decent looking responsive UI in no-time, but they're hardly customizable and bloat your markup. Stick to the custom CSS/SCSS for now.

### What you should know?
* Basics of responsive web design (responsive units, media queries, desktop/mobile first)
* CSS architecture (I recommend BEM)
* Basics of SASS/SCSS (nesting, variables, mixins, 7-1 pattern)
* Flexbox, CSS grid
* CSS animations

## 4. Add interactivity with JavaScript

Right now you should feel confident doing responsive sites and should have a couple of simple responsive projects under your belt. The next step in your journey should be learning **JavaScript.** It's a programming language of the web, and it's responsible for providing the ability for the user to interact with the DOM.

Here are the 2 possible routes you can take

* ### Free route

You should go back to the **freecodecamp** and start doing the JavaScript section. I'd personally omit the algorithm scripting for now, as there are more interesting ways to learn JavaScript in my opinion. But if you enjoy these kinds of exercises feel free to do them, you'll definitely get benefits by doing them after all.

When you'll learn the basics, now it's time to start doing some real projects. I recommend doing a couple of **Traversy Media** tutorials on Youtube. You'll create some simple apps with the help of Brad. If you want some more examples of practical projects - there's a free course by Wes Bos called **JavaScript 30.** It involves creating 30 simple apps with pure JavaScript. It's a great way to find out how powerful JavaScript truly is! You can find the course [here.](https://javascript30.com/)

Once you'll complete some projects when following along, now it's time to do something on your own. At this point you should have big enough code library that you can refer to, and if you don't know the solution to the problem, remember that the Internet is your friend. **Try creating a web app that you'll benefit from** - it may be a simple shopping list with local storage as a start! If you'll start creating something for yourself to use you should have higher motivation to complete the project.

* ### Paid route

When it comes to the paid content I recommend doing Brad Traversy's JavaScript course on Udemy - [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning.](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) It's a really broad course that will learn you all the way to the advanced concepts. It involves doing practical projects along the way so you can find the use cases for the theory you've learnt. By doing this course you should have a solid JS foundation that you can further develop.

After doing this course you should of course create a couple of simple projects on your own. You can use the chunks of code you've written during the course projects in your own ones :)

## 5. Choosing the JavaScript Framework

This is an extensive topic and deserves a blog post on its own, but I'll describe it in a nutshell here. Choosing a framework when you have solid JS foundations is a good idea. It simplifies your work with the DOM, makes the code more managable and saves you a lot of time. Most popular frameworks right now are **React,** **Angular** and **Vue.** You can check the differences between all of them in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWZ_4YBFBhs)

I personally chose React because it's vanilla ES6+ JavaScript for the most part. You don't have to learn directives and other framework-specific features, but on the other hand the JSX syntax isn't liked by some developers. Choose the framework you like the most, or the most popular on the job market in your area.

## What to do next?

If you're comfortable with all of the above - then you're armed to the teeth :) You should start creating some serious projects, work with other developers and even contribue to open source. But don't forget - there is **always** something new to learn.

## Summary

Tips above should give you an overview on how to learn modern front-end development :) It may sound like a lot of work, but if you'll **stay consistent** and **learn every single day**, you'll be surprised how much you can accomplish in a short period of time.
